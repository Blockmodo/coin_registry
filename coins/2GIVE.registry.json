    "en": "2GIVE is the next generation stakeholder based cryptocurrency designed to support socially responsible stewardship and is supported by the Strength in Numbers Foundation, a non-profit digital trust. 2GIVE makes it easy to support your favorite non-profit or pro-social cause and can be used for 'repaying it forward' through social tipping! The network is secured through a shared reward system that allows stakeholders the ability to generate 5% inflation adjusted return (POS) on their holdings per annum and a 1% transmission fee (TXFEE) that can be earned by the mining process (POW)."
