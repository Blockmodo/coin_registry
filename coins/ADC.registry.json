    "en": "The music industry is stacked with problems and politics making for a very uneven landscape in terms of fair share revenue and transparency. \nAs a fully decentralised coin ADC is available and open for all to build applications and solutions to rectify these inherent problems. After 4 years there are some very solid mainstream projects experimenting with adoption and this provides some encouragement for the future."
